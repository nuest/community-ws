## Workshop introduction

Research Software Engineering (RSE) has come a long way since the term was first coined less than 10 years ago. This development has been underpinned by a strong and continually growing community of researchers, software engineers and now, RSEs, who recognise the importance of software to the research community and its vital contribution to high-quality research outputs.

Researchers and academics have been building software as part of their research for many decades. However, the increasing importance of and need for software in undertaking research in many more domains led to more and more researchers spending their time focusing on software development. Combined with less time to spend on traditional research tasks, including writing papers, this led to the emergence of a group of experienced researchers with advanced software development skills who lacked the traditional CVs to progress along a standard academic career path. Ultimately, a group of individuals coming together and forming a community to advocate for the importance of software in research led to the RSE community that we have today. This demonstrates the huge importance of communities and what they can achieve. You can read the full story of the emergence of Research Software Engineering in Simon Hettrick's blog post "[_A not-so-brief history of Research Software Engineers_](https://www.software.ac.uk/blog/2016-08-17-not-so-brief-history-research-software-engineers-0)".

So, communities are very important! Unfortunately they're not always straightforward to set up and they can be even more challenging to sustain. Within the RSE community we now have a number of national communities, local communities at individual institutions and the first regional communities emerging.

This interactive workshop will provide an opportunity to share experiences, challenges and successes and to learn from experts in the wider field of community development, engagement and collaboration.

This workshop is being run as part of the [SORSE series on online research software events](https://sorse.github.io). Visit the [SORSE page for this workshop](https://sorse.github.io/programme/workshops/event-031/) for a link to register to attend the workshop.

## Speakers

We are delighted to welcome a range of speakers including leading experts in scientific community building and collaboration.

### Lou Woodley<br/><small>_Director, Center for Scientific Collaboration and Community Engagement ([CSCCE](https://www.cscce.org/))_</small>

<img src="assets/images/lw.jpg" width="150px" height="150px" style="float: left; margin-right: 20px; margin-bottom: 5px;">

Lou Woodley is founder and director of the Center for Scientific Collaboration and Community Engagement [CSCCE](https://www.cscce.org/). A scientist by training, Lou has spent over a decade building, studying, writing and teaching about communities in STEM. She champions the role of scientific community managers – the human infrastructure necessary for healthy, productive group work. Lou has previously led community-focused projects at Nature Publishing Group, Open Knowledge Foundation, and AAAS.

### Serah Rono<br/><small>_Director of Community Development and Engagement, [The Carpentries](https://carpentries.org/)_</small>

<img src="assets/images/sr.jpg" width="150px" height="150px" style="float: left; margin-right: 20px; margin-bottom: 5px;">

Serah Njambi Rono is a computer scientist and a writer. She is currently the Director of Community Development and Engagement at The Carpentries and has served as a technologist and Developer Advocate in the Open Data, Open Source, Open Science space for more than 8 years now while embedded at organisations like Open Knowledge Foundation and Code for Africa. She has broad and valuable experience in listening to and steering communities, developing and implementing strategies for various technical projects, and around community building, outreach and the sustainability of existing, mature communities. Serah invests her time and energy to work that serves as a precursor to propelling change across communities in different domains, and believes that the work does not stop until all communities are at par in terms of access to resources and empowerment by information that open source initiatives make available. This is the measure by which she defines impact. Often, the outcome of her work has been a spark in community conversations, contributions and adoptions on different subjects, increased opportunity for community leadership and participation, and pockets of knowledge transfer.

### Toby Hodges<br/><small>_Curriculum Community Developer, [The Carpentries](https://carpentries.org/)_</small>

<img src="assets/images/th.png" width="116px" height="150px" style="float: left; margin-right: 20px; margin-bottom: 5px;">

Toby Hodges (he/him) is the Curriculum Community Developer at The Carpentries. A former bioinformatician, Toby has spent the last six years helping community members to share their skills and knowledge. Before joining The Carpentries team in 2020 he managed the EMBL Bio-IT Project, working to build and support a community of bioinformaticians and computational biologists at the European Molecular Biology Laboratory. In his current role, Toby empowers community members to create new lessons in The Carpentries Incubator and develops programs to build connections between individuals with a shared interest in curriculum design and development.

## Session details

<div id="engagement-fundamentals"></div>

#### Scientific Community Engagement Fundamentals, _Lou Woodley_

Member participation in a community can occur in a range of modes, as described in the [CSCCE Community Participation Model](https://zenodo.org/record/3997802#.YDOdfWNOlpQ), created by staff at the Center for Scientific Collaboration and Community Engagement (CSCCE). In this interactive session, we’ll explore the four core modes and discuss how to meet members where they are to support your community in achieving its goals.


<div id="champions"></div>

#### Community Champions, _Lou Woodley_

 In [CSCCE’s Community Participation Model](https://zenodo.org/record/3997802#.YDOdfWNOlpQ), which describes the different modes of member engagement within a community, we call the members who take on leadership roles community champions. In this session we’ll explore the different roles that community champions can take on, why they’re important for the culture, growth and sustainability of a community, and how you can support them.


<div id="sustainability"></div>

#### Community sustainability, _Toby Hodges and Serah Rono_

One of the major challenges faced by many growing communities is to develop in a way that remains sustainable over time. In this session we will explore the concept of sustainability as it relates to scientific communities, discuss the advantages of promoting sustainability, and share resources and approaches you can use to make sure your community remains healthy, engaged, and effective as it continues to grow.
