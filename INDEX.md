## Workshop introduction

Research Software Engineering (RSE) has come a long way since the term was first coined less than 10 years ago. This development has been underpinned by a strong and continually growing community of researchers, software engineers and now, RSEs, who recognise the importance of software to the research community and its vital contribution to high-quality research outputs.

Researchers and academics have been building software as part of their research for many decades. However, the increasing importance of and need for software in undertaking research in many more domains led to more and more researchers spending their time focusing on software development. Combined with less time to spend on traditional research tasks, including writing papers, this led to the emergence of a group of experienced researchers with advanced software development skills who lacked the traditional CVs to progress along a standard academic career path. Ultimately, a group of individuals coming together and forming a community to advocate for the importance of software in research led to the RSE community that we have today. This demonstrates the huge importance of communities and what they can achieve. You can read the full story of the emergence of Research Software Engineering in Simon Hettrick's blog post "[_A not-so-brief history of Research Software Engineers_](https://www.software.ac.uk/blog/2016-08-17-not-so-brief-history-research-software-engineers-0)"


So, communities are very important! Unfortunately they're not always straightforward to set up and they can be even more challenging to sustain. Within the RSE community we now have a number of national communities, local communities at individual institutions and the first regional communities emerging.

This interactive workshop will provide an opportunity to share experiences, challenges and successes and to learn from experts in the wider field of community development, engagement and collaboration.

This workshop is being run as part of the [SORSE series on online research software events](https://sorse.github.io). Visit the [SORSE page for this workshop](https://sorse.github.io/programme/workshops/event-031/) for a link to register to attend the workshop.
